/*
Variable Prefixes and Types
a = array
b = boolean
d = database connection
f = float
h = stream/file/window handle;
i = integer
n = number (float or int)
o = generic object
p = string (path)
q = string (database query)
s = string (ambiguous)


Notes on naming conventions:
Variables should be camelCase.
Variables must contain a prefix.
Constants are all CAPS expect for the prefix.
E.g., A string called 'name' would be sName.
Class names MUST start with an upper case letter (treat as a proper noun).

Notes on Comment Blocks
ASSCI text is created using http://www.patorjk.com.
Large blocks use the 'Doom' font.
Medium blocks use the 'Slant' font.
Small areas use the 'Small' font.
